Offering over 200 monthly and weekly direct service distributions in Sonoma, Lake and Mendocino counties, the REFB also acquires and distributes food through a network of 170 charitable agencies that rely on the REFB to supply the food that fuels hunger-relief and human services programs spanning five counties, including Humboldt and Del Norte. In addition, the REFB advocates for effective legislation that will provide long-term solutions to hunger in our community.

We send good books, enough books for a whole class to use. Since 1988, Books For Africa has shipped more than 41 million books to every African country. They are on once-empty library shelves, in classrooms in rural schools, and in the hands of children who have never before held a book. Each book will be read over and over again. When the books arrive, they go to those who need them most: children who are hungry to read, hungry to learn, hungry to explore the world in ways that only books make possible.",

Children who come to Bivona's child-friendly setting receive a forensic interview, a medical evaluation, meet with a victim advocate, and connect with a therapist all in one place so they do not have to repeat their traumatic stories of abuse over and over again. Since Bivona opened its doors in 2004, nearly 24,000 children have been evaluated.",

Once accepted, first time homebuyers are eligible to buy a home from Habitat with a 20 - 25 year zero percent interest mortgage. Families spend a minimum of 300 hours investing in \"sweat equity\" where they support and help build their own home and the homes of their neighbors.

SCF began with a very simple idea: Convert what is considered \"waste\" in the Western world into much needed help in the East.<br>The idea became a reality when good quality used clothes and equipment-considered obsolete in the West but a huge leap forward in remote areas of the East-were soon being included in shipments. These supplies dramatically improved the quality of care in charitable hospitals. From its infancy, we realized the benefits of volunteerism. SCF volunteers see ourselves as catalysts, promoting low-cost, high-return programs at the grass-roots level, which have grown exponentially in last several years. We have been successful and instrumental in rebuilding lives in the rural communities of India where the government or the big nonprofits had little success. Our collaborative attitude and deep understanding of the rural issues helped overcome many challenges.",

Habitat for Humanity of Lee and Hendry Counties is one of the largest Habitat affiliates in the country, and has helped more than 1,700 families in Lee and Hendry counties become homeowners. Habitat homes are built through the use of volunteer labor and donations of money and materials. The homes are then sold to the homeowners with low or no interest mortgage and monthly payments set at less than 30% of the homeowner's income, making homeownership an affordable reality. Habitat homeowners must qualify financially for the program; save $2,000 toward their closing costs; attend classes focusing on homeownership, budgeting and home maintenance; and complete 300 hours of \"sweat equity\" by volunteering at Habitat.
